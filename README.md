### Introduction
smolSnekBoi! A modern take on the classic game! Here is my first project designed with JavaScript. Chase apples around the screen and grow bigger and bigger until you can eat no more! Snake is a game based on the old arcade classic game Blockade. My first introduction to the Snake game was on my, still indestructible, Nokia 3310. Throughout this project I have definitely increased my snake gameplay skills into a formidable force!  

### Game Play

### Game Over

### Controls

User controls available for both right handed and left handed people. Right handed controls are the arrow keys up, left, down, right; and for the lefties the keys A,S,D,W are used for the directional controls.

### Game Instructions

1. Start the game off as smolSnekBoi and use the directional controls to feed smolSneky with the apples that randomly appear on the screen.

2. Slowly you will gain size after each apple eaten.

3. To add to the gameplay satisfaction experience, as well as gaining in size as the game progresses, you will also gain speed, allowing only for the most skilled of players to reach high scores.

## Process

I started of by building the game by referencing other snake games already available on the internet. After thorough research, I first based my game off of basic HTML, which contained only one empty div class, a simple colour styling with CSS, and a grid and a smolSnekBoi composed in JavaScript. Then through a lot of hard work the gradual process of constructing a viable game began.

Time management on this project, I believe, was well allocated as I adhered to the set goals I had for each day. This allowed me at the end of the week to work on styling and extra features, and to decide on what looked good and what didn't.

This process has given me some good insight on how to structure projects in the future. The time management, even tho it went well, took a while to get used to at the beginning, but after a few days it really impacted my work. So, more attention to structuring organisation in the beginning would be how I would do things differently on future projects.

### Challenges

Among the many challenges I faced during the course of this project, overcoming them gave me a real sense of accomplishment. The first challenge I came in contact with was a rather funny bug that printed tons of apples when I started the game, to a point where it covered the entire screen! This was solved by adding an extra function to the createApple function, which took me a while to work out, but eventually i triumphed over it.

My most annoying issue was incrementing the speed of the snake then getting it to reset to its original speed after restarting the game. This was the most time consuming issue I ran into and was only worked out with the help of my peers. It's funny how you can get so wrapped up in a problem that can have such a simple solution to it, but that you cannot see as you are engrossed in your code.

### Wins

Well my main win would be successfully programming my first game, hooray!!

There were many wins along the way though, such as styling issues I struggled with prior to this week, but seemed to really understand afterwards; JavaScript issues as well which didn't make sense to me a week ago but now do; accomplishing things in a good time frame; and learning to code with others and read their code efficiently.


## Future features

There were a few things I would have liked to have added, such as a start screen, a high score reset button, animation in the snake array and some other things, but I am pretty happy with what I have created this week. I will definitely come back to this at some and add extras to it for the fun of it.
